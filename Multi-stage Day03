Sure, let's break down each command and explain their purpose for learning:

1. **Clone the Repository:**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/piyushsachdeva/todoapp-docker
   ```
   - `git clone` is used to create a copy of the repository from the given URL. This command downloads the project files from GitHub to your local machine.

2. **Change Directory:**
   ```bash
   cd todoapp-docker
   ```
   - `cd` stands for "change directory." This command navigates to the `todoapp-docker` directory, which contains the cloned repository.

3. **Create a Dockerfile:**
   ```bash
   touch Dockerfile
   ```
   - `touch` is used to create an empty file named `Dockerfile`. This file will contain instructions for building the Docker image.

4. **Edit the Dockerfile:**
   ```bash
   vi Dockerfile
   ```
   - `vi` is a text editor. This command opens the `Dockerfile` in the vi editor so you can add the necessary instructions for building your Docker image.

5. **View the Dockerfile:**
   ```bash
   cat Dockerfile
   ```
   - `cat` is used to display the contents of the `Dockerfile` in the terminal.

6. **Build the Docker Image:**
   ```bash
   docker build -t multi-stage:stage .
   ```
   - `docker build` creates a Docker image from the Dockerfile in the current directory (`.`).
   - `-t multi-stage:stage` tags the image with the name `multi-stage` and the tag `stage`.

7. **List Docker Images:**
   ```bash
   docker images
   ```
   - This command lists all Docker images currently available on your system.

8. **Tag the Docker Image:**
   ```bash
   docker tag multi-stage:stage srinathvelu/learningsri:stage
   ```
   - `docker tag` creates a new tag for an existing image. Here, it tags `multi-stage:stage` as `srinathvelu/learningsri:stage`.

9. **List Running Containers:**
   ```bash
   docker ps
   ```
   - `docker ps` lists all running Docker containers.

10. **Push the Docker Image:**
    ```bash
    docker push srinathvelu/learningsri:stage
    ```
    - `docker push` uploads the tagged image `srinathvelu/learningsri:stage` to the Docker registry.

11. **Pull the Docker Image:**
    ```bash
    docker pull srinathvelu/learningsri:stage
    ```
    - `docker pull` downloads the image `srinathvelu/learningsri:stage` from the Docker registry to your local machine.

12. **Run the Docker Container:**
    ```bash
    docker run -it -dp 3000:3000 srinathvelu/learningsri:stage
    ```
    - `docker run` starts a new container from the specified image.
    - `-it` makes the container interactive with a terminal.
    - `-dp 3000:3000` maps port 3000 of the container to port 3000 on the host machine.
    - `srinathvelu/learningsri:stage` specifies the image to use.

13. **Execute a Command Inside the Container:**
    ```bash
    winpty docker exec -it priceless_shirley sh
    ```
    - `docker exec` runs a command in a running container.
    - `-it` makes it interactive with a terminal.
    - `priceless_shirley` is the name of the running container.
    - `sh` starts a shell session inside the container.
    - `winpty` is used on Windows to provide proper terminal emulation for interactive commands.

Additional Learning
**Remove a Docker Image:**
    ```bash
    docker image rm multi-stage:latest
    ```
    - `docker image rm` removes the specified Docker image from your local machine.
    - `multi-stage:latest` is the name of the image to remove.

**Tag an Image with a New Name:**
    ```bash
    docker tag multi srinathvelu/learningsir:test
    ```
    - `docker tag` creates a new tag for an existing image. Here, it tags `multi` as `srinathvelu/learningsir:test`.

These commands cover the basic workflow of cloning a repository, creating a Docker image, running it, and managing Docker images and containers.

Learning;

you can run the image with the image name without tag or pushing into repository
docker run -it -d multi sh   ''' multi is the image name'''
winpty docker exec -it goofy_shtern sh  ''' the above command will create the container and the name is goofy'''

If you tag that to the dockerhub repository in this case srinathvelu/learningsri is my custom docker hub repo and the tag is srinathvelu/learningsri:stage anything after the colon indicates tag
if you have pushed that to the dockerhub registry you can use it for different environment with different tag
